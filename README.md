# Machine Learning Application with Docker

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to develop, containerize, and deploy a simple machine learning application using Docker. The application uses a decision tree classifier trained on the Iris dataset to make predictions. The project is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and run on any machine with Docker installed.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub
- Basic knowledge of Docker
